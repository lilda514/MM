        Initializes the PositionHandler class with a position data structure.

        Parameters
        ----------
        position : Position
            A structure to store position data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recv : Union[Dict, List]
            The received payload containing the position data.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Extract the position from the recv payload. Ensure *at least* the following data points are present:
            - side
            - price
            - size
            - uPnl
